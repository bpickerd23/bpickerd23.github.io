                    <p>Happy April Fools Day!</p>

                    <p>Hump Day is upon us. Send in the talking camels.  </p>

                    <p>Oh yes, what am I here for? What is my purpose? I want to tell you about design. I want to tell you about working in an industry where design isn't important. Some of the more prophetic artists and designers will tell you that a brand or an idea is nothing without great design.</p>

                    <p>I implore you to reconsider your grandiose claims, fellow designers. We live in a world of doers. A world of movers and shakers, CEO's and CFO's. People who believe that they themselves have the power to create their own designs. Why pay someone to do what comes naturally to them?</p>

                    <p>Who knows their brand better than the person who created it? I have heard it time and time again. Clients who believe that hiring me to design something for them is a great gift, for "exposure" for "fame" and "fortune". </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Alas, the truth is...</h2>

                    <p>They want to save money. These CEOs and CFOs and small business owners would just as soon use their own designs because they believe that they are just as good. There is something that is ultimately very patronizing about going into a meeting with a client thinking that they have no where else to turn and that you are their last hope... </p>

                    <p>But, your precious ego will soon be deflated...</p>

                    <blockquote>"For you see...LessSans, you and I both know that creating a logo is childs play. I have made one here for the purposes of selling my product. Yes, I know its fantastic and it will be challenging for you to do much better but I want you to try. For your valiant efforts you will be rewarded with the meager stipend that I see fit....as well as EXPOSURE." </blockquote>

                    <p>These sort of conversations happen all the time. What is important to keep in mind is that if you do not value your time, no one else will. Mr. CEO called you in for a reason. Someone assured him that they needed a second opinion.  </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">You're In Control</h2>

                    <p>I don't want to get preachy. But ultimately, you have to choice to walk out without the money. You don't need the $300 cold hard simoleans that this guy was "willing" to give you....no matter how many ramens that is. Don't be afraid to ask for a lot. This person will be utilizing this particular piece of branding for many many more deliverables and merchandise. Your "exposure" doesn't include your name or contact info next to any of them. You are talented and your talents are valuable. Don't let a logo be a stark reminder of that one time you really let someone pull one over on you. Let it be reminder of that big student loan payment you made, or that more frivolous (but equally as satisfying) PC purchase. </p>

                    

                    <p>So before leaving the meeting in shame. Come up with a big number. Don't be afraid of that big number. Embrace it. </p>

                    <p>Oh yeah, this post was about why I am writing this blog. I am creating this blog because I am a young designer who is still figuring it all out. I sometimes feel that design isn't important. But that isn't because I personally feel that way. It is because of the CEOs. The CEOs who believe that design doesn't come first. The same ones who believe that design doesn't sell a brand...the brand does. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Things always need fixing. If it breaks, get a bigger hammer. You should be that big hammer. The hammer of design justice. Get in, get your props, get your money, and leave on top.
